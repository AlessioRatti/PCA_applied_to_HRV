This folder contains the data from the Database already categorized.

- Folders -training- and -validation- contain the uncategorized data.
- Folder -Categories- is subdivided in Training and Validation samples, which are organized according to the
  REFERENCE information provided by experts from the competition as follow:

	- AF: Atrial Fibrilation 
	- N:  Normal Rhythm
	- Noisy: Too noisy to classify

  NOTE 1: The labels of each of the samples can be modified in order to facilitate the processing phase
  NOTE 2: The Matlab script for the classification of the samples is attached in the -Categories- Folder

To do:
- We need to decide the length of each of the samples in order to process them.
- Implement further processing steps.
